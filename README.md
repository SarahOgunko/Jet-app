# Jet app

This project fetches and displays restaurant data from the Just Eat API based on a given UK postcode. It focuses on displaying restaurant information, such as name, cuisines, rating, and address. The data is displayed in a simple web interface using React.

## Setup Instructions

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js 

npm 

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

### `git clone git@github.com:your-username/Jet-app.git`

2. Install Dependencies

cd jet-app
### `npm install`

3. CORS Setup 
To avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when making requests to the Just Eat API, you need to set up a CORS proxy.

 Use a Public CORS Proxy (CORS Anywhere)
To get started quickly, you can use a public CORS proxy such as CORS Anywhere. This allows you to bypass CORS restrictions without setting up your own proxy server.

You will need to request temporary access to the CORS proxy by visiting the following URL before making any requests: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo

After requesting access, the proxy will allow your app to make the necessary API calls.

4. Start the Application
Run the following command to start the development server:

### `npm start`
